campingstove
=============
campingstove is a boilerplate for platform independent mobile app development.

Philosophy
----------
The philosophy of campingstove is to get a basis for creating mobile apps in a fast and well structured way
for the most important mobile OS.

Currently campingstove includes example code and comments for a simple view and
a model. We are going to provide an additional, more naked version which will be less illustrative but allows to immediately start
writing you own app without having to remove preexisting code.

Frameworks
----------
The following frameworks are included in campingstove:

* [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) --- enables platform independent, installable apps
* [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) --- creates native-like UI
* [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) --- MVC-like coding pattern
* [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) --- modularize code

Use and contribute
------------------
Great if you like and use campingstove. Let us know if you have any suggestions, fork it and send pull requests to make
this even more useful for others. Thanks!

Instructions
------------
To actually get a mobile app you have to include campingstove in a project for any mobile OS SDK ([see phongap site](http://phonegap.com/start)).
