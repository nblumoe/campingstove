campingstove
=============
campingstove is a boilerplate for platform independent mobile app development.
It utilizes PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile, Backbone.js and Require.js.

PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile allow to develop mobile apps with a native feel using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Backbone.js gives MVC-like structure to your app and Require.js modularizes the code.

To actually get a mobile app you have to include campingstove in a project for any mobile OS SDK (see phongap site).
